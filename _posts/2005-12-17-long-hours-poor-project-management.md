> Lesson 4: Long hours? Poor project management.
> 
> Having been part of the design/development community for so long, Iâ€™m no stranger to the concept of â€œcrunch time.â€&#157; The fact that Iâ€™m running my own business only adds to the effect. Iâ€™ve been working 60-hour+ weeks for the past year, and yet it never feels like Iâ€™m doing enough.
> 
> However, Iâ€™ve come to realize lately that long hours arenâ€™t a badge of honor. If anything, they only highlight the need for better organization and management.
> 
> Itâ€™s easy to associate a huge workload with the idea that â€œbusiness is booming,â€&#157; but in reality, itâ€™s usually a sign of some (or all) of the following:
> 
>  \* Youâ€™re disorganized.  
>  \* Youâ€™re estimating inaccurately.  
>  \* Youâ€™re not managing your staff effectively.  
>  \* Youâ€™re giving â€œniceâ€&#157; deadlines to clients, instead of taking the time to explain and justify more realistic deadlines.  
>  \* Youâ€™re trying to do everything by yourself when you really should be bringing on additional help.

Well worth a read for all those thinking of starting up.
