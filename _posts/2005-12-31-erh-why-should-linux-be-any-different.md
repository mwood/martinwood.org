Elliotte Rusty Harold questions Linux as any normal consumer would – why can’t it use the same driver software as Windows?

I was asking myself the same question a few weeks back installing Ubuntu on a Sony Vaio laptop which has a native 1400×1050 resolution which it miserably failed to detect.

Only after a few hours of tinkering (i.e. Googling) did I manage to get it to work, but then there was the lack of sound, hibernate/sleep facilities, etc. and I was quickly back in Windows on that machine – and the comfort of OS X elsewhere.

(Those cheap Intel PowerBooks can’t come quickly enough.)
