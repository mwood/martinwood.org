My first remote gig was in 2005 – and since 2007, apart from some brief dalliances with on-site work, I’ve been **fully remote.**

This suits my (highly) introverted personality. I find working in groups exhausting – I’d much rather get on with ‘doing the work’ than trying to juggle chunks of small-talk with second-guessing where the next interruption will come from.

(That’s before the *other* part of my brain would kick in and make me self-conscious about ‘doing the work’ and not small-talking, third-guessing my own actions. Brains are *complicated* like that.)

That said, my first decade of being a developer was on-site in teams of various sizes, and the lessons learned during that time period, technically and with the ‘softer’ skills, I wouldn’t be without.

## Be on-site, at least initially

To be an effective remote worker I believe **you have to ‘do the time’ as an on-site worker** to understand the machinations of work, the office politics, the petty bureaucracy.

Whilst you will be mostly sheltered from these as a remote worker, knowing their influence and origin will benefit you when it comes to understanding days where you are waiting for an invoice to be paid, having a contract pulled from under your feet, or simply seeing specifications change before your eyes.

I certainly **wouldn’t advise, say a graduate, to have their first job be a remote job.**

You need exposure to team processes, to version control, to deployment strategies – stuff that a University course, at least 25 years ago, didn’t teach. Do a few years \*at least\* in the ‘real’ world.

## Set limits

I have a hard rule about working a maximum of six hours a day.

These are \*remote hours\* though, and in a classic ‘well, he would say that wouldn’t be’ belief, I honestly do think that **one hour of remote working is equal to around 1.5 hours of non-remote work**, given the intensity of effort when working on your own, coupled with the lack of interruptions (the daily sauntering of my cat across my keyboard notwithstanding).

## Have a schedule

For the last ten years I’ve worked in 4x90min blocks per day with 30min breaks between.

I haven’t looked into the science, but a block of 90min is enough for me to get into ‘[deep work](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/0349411905/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=deep+work&qid=1582134441&sr=8-1)‘ territory, without getting dragged too far under my own OCD for completing what’s in front of me.

Having set cut-off times is essential. Work ends when it ends. Of course, there will be the *occasional* emergency which requires fire-fighting out of hours, but these should be rare.

## Leave the house

If you are remote working from home it’s so easy to get stuck in a rut of not leaving the house at all one day, which can turn into a streak, and before you know it you are a full card-carrying member of the [UNIX beard](https://www.google.co.uk/search?sxsrf=ALeKk01qF9Fs_A2qaRucjaimcjw7eObBKg:1582132728781&q=unix+beard&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjo_6Taj97nAhWDqHEKHTL7DmIQsAR6BAgKEAE&biw=931&bih=583) club and the only people you speak to are delivery drivers who have the wrong house.

**Do *something*Â outside at least once a day**, a morning walk or run at least. Dogs are a remote worker’s best friend (except when you are doing conference calls…).

## Conclusion

Would I recommend it? Yes! I’d certainly struggle to work any other way, but it’s definitely not the only way, and shouldn’t be your initial way.
