Well, I’ve only gone and done it, folks.

I’ve finally become a bona fide [Micro-ISV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_ISV) (mISV).

Today marks the launch of my first product, [Datafeed Studio](http://datafeedstudio.com) – a web application that allows affiliate marketeers to create price comparison sites, niche online stores and product compare pages from CSV datafeed files provided by online merchants.

Running my own business has always been a dream of mine, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank those people who have inspired me to take the leap from the lucrative world of contracting into the far riskier realms of being a one-man product making machine.

First and foremost I’d like to thank my wife and two young ones for their support and understanding this year as I’ve been developing [Datafeed Studio](http://datafeedstudio.com).

Other influences include :

1. [Bob Walsh](http://47hats.com) – perhaps *the* voice for the mISV community. [Micro-ISV : From Vision to Reality](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FMicro-ISV-Vision-Reality-Bob-Walsh%2Fdp%2F1590596013%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1211806874%26sr%3D8-1&tag=360bundles-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=360bundles-21&l=ur2&o=2)  
     is still the mISV bible – I guess now I better start reading [this](http://47hats.com/index.php/2008/02/15/microisv-sites-that-sell/) in earnest.
2. [Eric Sink](http://www.ericsink.com/) – author of another mISV [classic](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.uk%2FEric-Business-Software-Experts-Voice%2Fdp%2F1590596234%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1211806874%26sr%3D8-1&tag=360bundles-21&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=360bundles-21&l=ur2&o=2).
3. [Steve Pavlina](http://stevepavlina.com) – former shareware author and now a personal development guru, always challenging, always inspiring.
4. [Business of Software](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/?biz) forum. Maybe I can stop lurking now that I’ve earned my stripes and got myself a product? 🙂
5. [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) – great musings on software development, and for [FogBUGZ](http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ/), which I’ve only just started using but it looks like it could save me a **lot** of headaches.
6. [Andy Brice](http://successfulsoftware.net/) – fellow Brit and a great contributor to the mISV community. Thanks for the software and marketing tips on your blog, Andy.

So – what’s the plan from here on in?

Well, much as I’d love to make a full-time income from my product, I don’t think that’s viable just yet.

By the end of this year I’d like Datafeed Studio to make 20% of my monthly income (the other 80% coming from freelance web application gigs (Ruby/Rails, PHP, etc.), which, yes, I am [still available](https://martinwood.org/contact/) for if anyone is interested in working with a reliable, hard-working developer type).

I am to increase this percentage by 20% each year, so in five years all my income is from my own products. Well, that’s the *dream* anyway. Only time will tell…
