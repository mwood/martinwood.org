I am a freelance software developer based in Cardiff, Wales (UK) who specialises in delivering quality web applications.

I have been developing commercial web applications since 1997 – with particular experience in building large-scale web sites, mainly for the government and education industries, utilising the following technologies:

- **Ruby on Rails (main skill, 10+ years experience)**
- **Javascript (jQuery, AngularJS, ReactJS)**
- SQL (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres)
- Java (Apache Tomcat, WebLogic, J2EE)
- PHP
- XHTML/CSS/XML/XSLT

I am happiest working on UNIX based platforms.

If you have a project, large or small, that you think might interest me [get in touch](/contact).
